📄 Project Description
This project delivers a complete, end-to-end machine learning solution to a critical business challenge: predicting customer response to email marketing campaigns. By leveraging a dataset of historical email interactions, our model accurately classifies whether a customer is likely to respond to an email advertisement.

The entire solution is containerized using Docker and deployed on Hugging Face Spaces, showcasing a professional MLOps workflow from development to deployment.

🎯 The Business Problem
In email marketing, a low response rate can lead to wasted resources and missed opportunities. Our predictive model helps businesses overcome this by enabling a data-driven approach to targeting. The solution provides a powerful tool for marketing teams to:

Optimize Campaign Targeting: Identify and focus on customers with the highest propensity to respond.

Improve Engagement: Deliver personalized and relevant content to the right audience.

Increase Efficiency: Reduce email traffic to uninterested users, improving email deliverability and reducing costs.

Boost ROI: Maximize the return on investment for marketing campaigns by directing resources where they will have the most impact.

✨ Key Features
Full MLOps Pipeline: Demonstrates a complete workflow from data ingestion and preprocessing to model training, containerization, and public deployment.

Robust Classification Model: A machine learning model trained on numerical and categorical features to provide actionable predictions.

Dockerized Application: Ensures a portable, consistent, and scalable deployment environment, eliminating compatibility issues.

Interactive Web Application: A user-friendly, public-facing demo on Hugging Face Spaces for easy interaction and demonstration.

Clear Predictions: The model outputs a probability score, making the prediction easy to understand and use for business decisions.

⚙️ Technical Stack
Programming Language: Python 3.x

Machine Learning Frameworks: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy

Containerization: Docker

Web Application: Streamlit (or Flask if used)

Deployment Platform: Hugging Face Spaces

🧠 Model & Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing:

Loaded data from the Email_Marketing_Campaign_Dataset_Rounded.xlsx file.

Handled missing values and outliers.

Encoded categorical features using techniques like One-Hot Encoding.

Scaled numerical features to ensure all features contribute equally to the model training process.

2. Feature Engineering:

Created new features from existing data to enhance model performance.

The model was trained on a rich set of numerical and categorical features, including:

Age

Income

Campaign_Duration

Customer_Segment

...and other relevant features from the dataset.

3. Model Training:

Explored and evaluated several supervised machine learning classification algorithms.

The final model was selected based on its performance on key metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

To prevent overfitting, techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning were employed.

🐳 Deployment with Docker & Hugging Face Spaces
To guarantee a seamless and reproducible deployment, the entire application is containerized using Docker. The Dockerfile packages the src code, the trained model, the scaler, and all Python dependencies into a single, portable image.

The requirements.txt file ensures all necessary libraries are installed within the container.

This Docker image is then easily deployed to Hugging Face Spaces, which automatically runs the Streamlit application and exposes it to the public, providing an instant and accessible demo of the project.

💻 How to Run Locally
If you wish to build the Docker image and run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Email-classification-project.git
cd Email-classification-project
2. Build the Docker image:

Ensure you have Docker installed and running on your system.

Bash

docker build -t email-response-prediction .
3. Run the Docker container:

Bash

docker run -p 8501:8501 email-response-prediction
The Streamlit application will be accessible at http://localhost:8501 in your web browser.
